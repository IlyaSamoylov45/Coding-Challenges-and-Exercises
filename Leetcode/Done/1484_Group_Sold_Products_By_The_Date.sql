-- +-------------+---------+
-- There is no primary key for this table, it may contains duplicates.
-- Each row of this table contains the product name and the date it was sold in a market.
--
--
-- Write an SQL query to find for each date, the number of distinct products sold and their names.
--
-- The sold-products names for each date should be sorted lexicographically.
--
-- Return the result table ordered by sell_date.
--
-- The query result format is in the following example.
--
-- Activities table:
-- +------------+-------------+
-- | sell_date  | product     |

-- +------------+----------+------------------------------+

-- +------------+----------+------------------------------+
-- For 2020-05-30, Sold items were (Headphone, Basketball, T-shirt), we sort them lexicographically and separate them by comma.
-- For 2020-06-01, Sold items were (Pencil, Bible), we sort them lexicographically and separate them by comma.
-- For 2020-06-02, Sold item is (Mask), we just return it.






-- Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT sell_date, COUNT(DISTINCT(product)) as num_sold, GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT product ORDER BY product ASC SEPARATOR ',') AS products
FROM Activities
GROUP BY sell_date
ORDER BY sell_date
