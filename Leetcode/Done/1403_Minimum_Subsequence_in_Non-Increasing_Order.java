// Given the array nums, obtain a subsequence of the array whose sum of elements is strictly greater than the sum of the non included elements in such subsequence.
//
// If there are multiple solutions, return the subsequence with minimum size and if there still exist multiple solutions, return the subsequence with the maximum total sum of all its elements. A subsequence of an array can be obtained by erasing some (possibly zero) elements from the array.
//
// Note that the solution with the given constraints is guaranteed to be unique. Also return the answer sorted in non-increasing order.
//
//
//
// Example 1:
//
// Input: nums = [4,3,10,9,8]
// Output: [10,9]
// Explanation: The subsequences [10,9] and [10,8] are minimal such that the sum of their elements is strictly greater than the sum of elements not included, however, the subsequence [10,9] has the maximum total sum of its elements.
// Example 2:
//
// Input: nums = [4,4,7,6,7]
// Output: [7,7,6]
// Explanation: The subsequence [7,7] has the sum of its elements equal to 14 which is not strictly greater than the sum of elements not included (14 = 4 + 4 + 6). Therefore, the subsequence [7,6,7] is the minimal satisfying the conditions. Note the subsequence has to returned in non-decreasing order.
// Example 3:
//
// Input: nums = [6]
// Output: [6]
//
//
// Constraints:
//
// 1 <= nums.length <= 500
// 1 <= nums[i] <= 100
